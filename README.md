# Password Generator

## Description
This password generator website was made to create randomized passwords based on the inputs of the user. It allows you to make a password between 8 and 128 characters in length with the option to include several different characterstics. In order for this site to function properly, I had to manipulate the JavaScript to have prompts and confirmations that would help build the password. Ultimately, I created a function that made a random password that would display on the computer screen.

## Usage
The webpage has a simple design with a header at the top and a box that will eventually display your secure password. In order to create this password, you must first click on the red "Generate Password" button. This button can be seen in the photo of the site below.

Once you click on the "Generate Password" button, you will be prompted to enter how many characters you want in your password. If you enter a number less than 8 or more than 128 an alert will pop-up letting the user know that the password must be at least 8 characters and less than 129 characters. Once you enter a valid character amount, you are prompted to confirm if you want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, or numbers in your password. By clicking on the "OK" button seen in the photo, you are confirming that you want that property included in your password. By clicking on "Cancel", you are confirming that you do NOT want that property included in your password. For example, if I click on "OK" for numbers, then they will be present in my password; however, if I click on "Cancel" for the numbers property, then you will not have numbers in your password. Once you reach the final prompt, which is asking about special characters, your password will be generated and replace the "Your Secure Password" phrase on the webpage. To re-create a new password, simply hit the "Generate Password" button again and enter the new parameters.
